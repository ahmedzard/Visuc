        numpy, tensorflow, Pillow, playsound

Steps:
1. downlaod the following files to a proper place on your device
    - music_files
    - images
    - classifier.py
    - colormodel_trained_90.h5
2. extract the muci_files rar file 
3. extract the images rar file
4. open classifier.py in a proper txt editor 
5. replace the path of "colormodel_trained_90.h5" file to the proper path on your device (line 15)
6. replace the path of "image" file to the proper path on your device (line 50)
7. replace the path of all "music" files to the proper path on your device (line77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101, 104, 107)

    ex, cd C:\Users\ahm\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39
10. run the following command:
    py <PATH_OF_CLASSIFIER.PY_FILE>\classifier.py   ---> don't forget to replace <PATH_OF_CLASSIFIER.PY_FILE> with the proper path of the file on your device 
    
    
 11. if you faced any issue in running the code:
        - you can search for the error code on the python doc website (https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html)
